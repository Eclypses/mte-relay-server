headers: 
x-mte-relay-server-id
	- issued by the server
	- always the same
	- identifies the server, so that the client can manage connections with multiple servers (this can also be accomplished with a fully-qualifed url)
x-mte-relay-client-id
	- issued by the server
	- signed with a secret
	- client must include this on every request
	- used by the server to identify unique clients
x-mte-relay-session-id
	- issued by the client
	- optional
	- if included, the server will create a new encoder/decoder pair using the session-id+client-id headers.
x-mte-relay-eh: 
	- MKE encrypted headers
	- this should always include Content-Type

When creating encoded headers:
if mteOptions.encodeHeaders === false
	return headers
if mteOptions.encodeHeaders === true
	create an object with all headers as key:value pairs
	convert the object to a string (JSON)
	mke Encrypt the string
if mteOptions.encodeHeaders === Array
	check if all items in array are strings
		if not, throw error
	create object to store headers as key:value pairs
	for each string in array
		check if it exists in headers
			if it does, add it as a key:value pair to a headers
	convert the object to a string (JSON)
	mkeEncrypt string
